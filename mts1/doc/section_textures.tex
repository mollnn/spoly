\subsection{Textures}
\label{sec:textures}
The following section describes the available texture data sources. In Mitsuba,
textures are objects that can be attached to certain
surface scattering model parameters to introduce spatial variation.
In the documentation, these are listed as supporting the ``\Texture'' type.
See \secref{bsdfs} for many examples.
